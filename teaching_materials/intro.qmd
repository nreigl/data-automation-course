---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Access and explore data from Statistics Estonia and DBnomics
- Automate data downloads and updates
- Build clean, reproducible reports with R and Quarto

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Weâ€™ll Use

- **R** and **RStudio**
- Quarto
- Tidyverse
- APIs (`rdbnomics`, `pxweb`)

## Why Write Code Instead of Using Excel?

- âœ… **Repeatability**: Run once, use forever.  
- âœ… **Transparency**: All steps are visible in the script.  
- âœ… **Scalability**: Works for 1 or 100 datasets.  
- âœ… **Fewer Errors**: Avoid manual mistakes.  
- âœ… **Version Control**: Track changes, collaborate easily.
